                        <strong>Dear Nayaa Leeandra Maharajan,</strong>
                        <p>
                            This is the first time working with something like this so cut me some slack. We have been through a lot from last girlfriend's day to this one. 
                            If you ask me one year ago how things would pan out, my jaw would be on the ground. I don't think there has ever been a middle ground with us. 
                            There are always two extremes, and that suits you a lot because you're an overthinker, so that's exactly how you feel things. 
                            I'm proud of how far you've come and how much you've pushed yourself through the worst conditions. Thank you for showing me unconditional love throughout it all. 
                            Also, thank you for always being the constant in a life of change. I love you. Happy girlfriend's day.
                        </p>
